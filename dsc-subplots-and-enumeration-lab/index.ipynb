This is set to `0.2` by default, meaning that the amount of space between our plots is equal to 20% of the width of the plots. Let's set `wspace=0.4`, and see how that looks.\n",

    "Great! There are plenty of situations where `enumerate()` comes in very handy. By allowing us to get the index and the value at the same time, it makes it simple to manipulate one variable based on the value of the other. This is a natural requirement of subplots.\n",

    "To end this lab, we'll see how we can use `enumerate` to easily subplot this entire DataFrame by country -- all 263 of them!\n",
    "\n",
    "It will work like this. We'll begin by grouping each row in our DataFrame by `'Country Name'`. Then, we'll create a `plt.figure()` and set the figure size to `(20,40)`. We'll also set the `facecolor` to `'white'`, so that it's a bit easier to read. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then comes the fun part. We'll enumerate through our grouped DataFrame. Just looping through a grouped DataFrame returns a tuple containing the index and the rows with that country name. Since we're grouped by `'Country Name'`, this means that the index will actually be the `'Country Name'`. However, we're not just looping through the grouped DataFrame -- we're `enumerate`-ing through it! \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for index, (value1, value2) in enumerate(grouped_DataFrame):\n",
    "    # index is an integer, starting at 0 and counting up by 1 just \n",
    "    # like we would expect a for loop to do\n",
    "    \n",
    "    #(value1, value2) is a tuple containing the name of the country as value 1\n",
    "    # (since it is acting as the index because we grouped everything by it),\n",
    "    # and value 2 is all the rows that belong to that country's group. \n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the `index` for our enumeration will be an integer value that counts higher by 1 with each country. If we just add 1 to it (because subplots start counting at 1, but Python starts counting at 0), then this number will correspond with the index we need to pass in as the third parameter in `plt.subplot()` -- the parameter that specifies which plot inside the subplot should show the plot we're about to create. \n",
